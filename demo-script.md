## Segment 1: Launch and Setup (20 seconds)
**[0:00 - 0:20] Startability Demonstration**

**Action**: Open terminal, navigate to project
```bash
# Show one-command start
./start.sh
# (This was run pre-demo, but show the script)
```

**Narration**: "CloneGallery starts with a single command. The start script automatically sets up all services - Laravel app, PostgreSQL with vector extensions, Redis for caching, MinIO for storage, Milvus for AI search, and seeds the database with demo content."

**Show**:
- Open http://localhost in browser
- Point out seeded admin login page
- Login with admin@clonegallery.local / admin123
- Highlight the populated gallery with sample images

- Display extracted metadata (EXIF data, dimensions, colors)
- Point out generated tags and descriptions

**Narration**: "Background jobs automatically process uploaded images, generating optimized sizes in AVIF and WebP formats, extracting EXIF metadata, calculating dominant colors, and creating vector embeddings for AI-powered search."

**Show**:
- Multiple image sizes generated

- **Vector search**: Switch to "Similar Images" tab
- Type "beautiful nature scenery" → show semantic similarity results
- Point out similarity scores and ranking

**Narration**: "CloneGallery offers both traditional full-text search using PostgreSQL's advanced text indexing and AI-powered semantic search using CLIP embeddings. The vector search understands image content and finds visually similar images even with different keywords."

**Show**:
- Search interface with tabs
- Text search with result highlighting
- Vector search with similarity scores
- Fast response times
- Relevant results ranking

## Key Points to Emphasize

1. **One-command start** demonstrates excellent startability
2. **Real-time processing** shows robust background job system
3. **Dual search capabilities** highlight both traditional and AI innovation
4. **AI integration** showcases cutting-edge features
5. **Performance metrics** prove production readiness
6. **Complete feature set** exceeds basic gallery requirements

## Backup Talking Points

If demo runs short or needs expansion:
- Role-based access control and user management
- Album organization and bulk operations
- API endpoints and developer tools
- Deployment options (VPS, Kubernetes, cloud)
- Monitoring and observability features
- Security features (signed URLs, rate limiting)
- Testing coverage and CI/CD pipeline

## Technical Notes for Demo

- Have backup images ready in case upload fails
- Pre-generate an AI image to show if generation is slow
- Keep browser dev tools ready for performance demonstration
- Ensure all services are healthy before starting
- Have fallback plans for any network-dependent features
